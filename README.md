# One-page-shopping-mall-
Creating a Flask project using shopping mall feature API. 

Here, one-page shopping mall page does two things : 

1) Make an order(POST): after clicking the ‘order button’, the information should be added in the list.
2) See the order list(GET): after page loading, the order list is updated.
